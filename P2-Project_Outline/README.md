# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
The group project we selected is: Event management and volunteer signup web app for nonprofits or organizations in general. The app is meant to create a common or unifying platform that connects non-profit organizations to prospective and available volunteers for upcoming events. The app will focus on making organizing multiple events and utilization of volunteers for those events as simple and interative as possible.

### Features
The project will have the following features at the minimum:
1) Volunteers sign up for events that creators can approve: Interested volunteers will be able to view a list of all available events and select what event/task they want to feature in. In return, the organizers will have the authority to either approve or delete the event/time signed up for.

2) Organizer signup and login: Representatives from non-profit organzations must be able to sign up for the service and login to create events, edit events, select and approve signed-up volunteers.

3) Create and edit events: Organizers and facilitators must be able to crreate and change the events while logged in.

4) Search for events: Logged in user will be able to search for all events and/or volunteers. User should also be able to search for specific events using specific keywords. A failed attempt message should be displayed when search term is not available.

5) Delete Events: This feature will be one that can only be executed by only the admin and/or creator of the event. The user that created some events will be able to view all the events they created, select unwanted ones and delete where necessary after they authenticate their intention to do so.

### Technologies:
Technologies we will be using are: Java, Spring Boot, MySQL, Hibernate, Thymeleaf templates.
### What I'll Have to Learn
I will need to learn working with a team on a programming task. I think it will be interesting using the trello board to keep track of our progress. Although the concepts have been covered in LC101, I believe I will be learning practical applications of all the concepts as well as the confidence to live code.
